## üåü Features

- **Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication. The server handles user sessions and token management, ensuring protected routes and actions.
- **Design**: Implemented with Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and customizable user interface. The Tailwind utility-first approach ensures a clean and maintainable CSS codebase.
- **Content Interaction**: Users can like and comment on posts. The server manages these interactions through RESTful APIs, with CRUD operations for comments and like counts.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Built with role-based access control (RBAC), the dashboard allows admins to manage posts, users, and comments. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- **Search Functionality**: Integrated with a search feature that supports querying posts by category, keyword, or title. This functionality is powered by efficient indexing and querying techniques on the MongoDB database.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Allows for the creation, updating, and deletion of posts. Implemented using Express.js for REST API endpoints and MongoDB for data storage.
